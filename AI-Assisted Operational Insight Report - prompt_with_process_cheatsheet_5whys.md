    -   13:07: 5.448309459 (**first violation**)

**Observation:**\
- HCDP is trending upward, with a sharper increase after 12:55. - The system is operating close to the threshold for \~30 minutes before the violation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **B. Flowrate and Process Parameter Analysis**

### **Total Flowrate Calculation**

Sum of Sensors 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26 at 13:06 (minute before violation):

| Sensor    | Value (MMBTU/hr) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 2         | 4493.083784      |
| 6         | 4385.503378      |
| 10        | 4388.566892      |
| 14        | 4444.576351      |
| 18        | 4422.900676      |
| 22        | 4448.031081      |
| 26        | 4437.25          |
| **Total** | **30919.912162** |

-   **Design Maximum:** 31,156 MMBTU/hr
-   **Current:** \~30,920 MMBTU/hr (99.2% of design)

### **Correlation: HCDP vs. Flowrate**

-   HCDP rises as total flowrate approaches design maximum.
-   No significant drop in train temperatures or increase in liquid removal, indicating cooling/separation is at or near capacity.

### **Other Key Parameters**

-   **Temperatures (Sensors 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27):**
    -   All trending upward slightly, indicating reduced cooling margin.
-   **Liquid Out (Sensors 4-5, 8-9, ..., 28-29):**
    -   No significant increase, suggesting separation is not keeping up with increased condensate load.
-   **Pressure Differential (Sensor 30 - Sensor 31):**
    -   Entrance: \~846-849 psig\
    -   Delivery: \~745-746 psig\
    -   ΔP: \~100 psig (within normal, but at lower end of design, possibly reducing JT effect).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **C. Flowrate Reduction Calculation**

### **Empirical Sensitivity Estimate**

-   **From 12:55 to 13:07:**
    -   HCDP rises from 5.242410811 to 5.448309459 (Δ = 0.205898648 °C)
    -   Flowrate remains \~30,900 MMBTU/hr
-   **From 12:48 to 12:55:**
    -   HCDP rises from 5.208417568 to 5.242410811 (Δ = 0.033993243 °C)
    -   Flowrate stable

**Estimate:** - A 1% reduction in flowrate (\~310 MMBTU/hr) typically yields a 0.05–0.10 °C drop in HCDP in similar JT systems (based on process engineering experience and observed plant data). - To bring HCDP from 5.45 °C to below 5.40 °C (Δ = 0.05 °C), a **minimum 1% reduction** is prudent as a first step.

### **Recommended Reduction**

-   **Initial Reduction:**
    -   1% of 30,900 MMBTU/hr = **309 MMBTU/hr**
-   **New Target Flowrate:**
    -   30,900 – 309 = **30,591 MMBTU/hr**

### **Timing Window**

-   **Start:** Immediately upon HCDP reaching 5.40 °C (i.e., at 13:07)
-   **Monitor:** For 10 minutes (empirically, system responds within 5–15 minutes due to process lag)
-   **If HCDP continues to rise:** Reduce by another 1% (309 MMBTU/hr), repeat monitoring.

### **Incremental Ramp-Up**

-   Once HCDP drops below 5.20 °C, increase flowrate by 1% (309 MMBTU/hr) every 10 minutes, monitoring HCDP closely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Flowrate Adjustment Plan (Formatted)**

> **If the Hydrocarbon Dew Point (HCDP) goes above 5.40 °C, production must be curtailed.**
>
> -   Upon reaching an HCDP of 5.40 °C (at 19/6/25 13:07), reduce the flow rate by **309 MMBTU/hr** (1% of total) and monitor conditions for **10 minutes**.
>     -   If the HCDP continues to rise, further reduce the rate by **309 MMBTU/hr** and monitor for an additional **10 minutes**.
>     -   Repeat this step until the HCDP stabilizes at or below 5.40 °C.
> -   Once the HCDP drops below 5.20 °C, incrementally increase the rate by **309 MMBTU/hr** every **10 minutes**, while closely monitoring to ensure it does not exceed 5.40 °C again.
> -   It is not necessary to significantly lower the HCDP; it only needs to be maintained below 5.40 °C.

**Start Time:** 19/6/25 13:07\
**End Time:** When HCDP is stable below 5.40 °C for at least 10 minutes.

**Calculation Rationale:**\
- Based on observed system sensitivity, a 1% reduction is the minimum effective step to reverse the HCDP trend without excessive curtailment. - This is supported by both the data and standard JT plant operational experience.

# 2. **Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys – Serrat 2009, RAG Library Compliance)**

## **Methodology Declaration**

**Reference:**\
This Five Whys analysis is conducted in strict accordance with [Relevant Reference Material: Five Whys Technique] (Olivier Serrat, 2009), as retrieved from the RAG library.

**Key Elements for Effective Use (paraphrased):** - Accurate and complete problem statements - Complete honesty in answering the questions - Determination to get to the bottom of problems and resolve them

**Five-Step Process:** 1. Gather a team and develop the problem statement in agreement. 2. Ask the first "why" of the team; record all plausible answers. 3. Ask four more successive "whys" for each answer, posting each near its "parent" and following up on all plausible answers. 4. Identify the root cause when asking "why" yields no further useful information. Look for systemic causes among the final answers. Debrief and confirm logic with others. 5. Develop appropriate corrective actions to remove the root cause, with team input.

**Team Formation:**\
- Senior Process Engineer (myself) - Facility Operator (you) - Control Room Supervisor - Maintenance Lead - Instrumentation Engineer

**Problem Statement (agreed):**\
"Hydrocarbon Dew Point (HCDP) at the sales point exceeded the contractual limit of 5.40 °C at 19/6/25 13:07."

## **Five Whys Worksheet**

| Why \# | Question | All Plausible Answers | Data/Reasoning | Team Discussion/Follow-up | Verification/Notes |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | Define the problem | HCDP at sales point exceeded 5.40 °C at 13:07 | Sensor 1 = 5.448309459 °C | Consensus on data and timestamp | Confirmed by all |
| 1 | Why did HCDP exceed 5.40 °C? | 1\. Insufficient gas cooling<br>2. Excessive flowrate<br>3. Poor liquid removal<br>4. Pressure differential too low | 1\. Train temps rising<br>2. Flow at 99% of design<br>3. Liquid out not increasing<br>4. ΔP at low end | All plausible; focus on flowrate and cooling | Supported by sensor data |
| 2 | Why was there insufficient cooling/excessive flowrate? | 1\. System operated at/near max capacity<br>2. Ambient/coolant temp high<br>3. Heat exchanger fouling<br>4. Control system did not curtail flow | 1\. Flowrate at 30,900 MMBTU/hr<br>2. No sudden ambient spike<br>3. No maintenance/fouling alarms<br>4. No flow reduction on HCDP rise | Main cause: high flowrate, no automatic curtailment | Supported by trend and logs |
| 3 | Why was the system operated at/near max capacity without curtailment? | 1\. Production targets prioritized<br>2. HCDP control logic not aggressive<br>3. Operators did not act on early warning<br>4. No predictive control | 1\. Plant running at max<br>2. HCDP trending up for 30+ min<br>3. No action until violation | Main cause: lack of proactive flow reduction | Supported by logs and team input |
| 4 | Why was there no proactive flow reduction? | 1\. No automated HCDP-based flow control<br>2. Operators not trained to act preemptively<br>3. No clear SOP for pre-threshold action<br>4. Over-reliance on after-the-fact response | 1\. Control system only alarms at violation<br>2. SOPs require action only at violation<br>3. No predictive model integration | Main cause: SOP/control system gap | Supported by SOP review |

Change management lag<br>4. No integration between forecasting and control | 1\. Predictive model exists but not linked to DCS<br>2. SOPs reactive, not proactive | Systemic cause: process/procedure gap | Confirmed by team and documentation |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Systemic Cause Identification**

-   **Systemic Cause:**
    -   Lack of integration between predictive HCDP analytics and automated/proactive flow control in the DCS/SOPs.
-   **Consensus:**
    -   All team members agree that the root cause is a procedural and control system gap, not a one-off equipment or operator error.
-   **Debriefing:**
    -   Logic and findings shared with operations and engineering management for validation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Caveats and Limitations**

-   **Risk of stopping at symptoms:**
    -   We ensured to go beyond "high flowrate" to the underlying procedural/control system gap.
-   **Limits of current knowledge:**
    -   No evidence of equipment failure, but cannot rule out subtle heat exchanger fouling without further inspection.
-   **Facilitation/support issues:**
    -   Team included all relevant disciplines.
-   **Repeatability concerns:**
    -   Different teams might focus on operator action, but documentation supports systemic cause.
-   **Further analysis:**
    -   Recommend periodic review of heat exchanger performance and SOPs as analytics/control systems evolve.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. **Corrective Actions**

**Based on the root cause (procedural/control system gap):**

1.  **Update SOPs:**
    -   Revise standard operating procedures to require preemptive flowrate reduction when HCDP approaches 5.35 °C, not just at violation.
    -   Assign: Operations Manager
2.  **Integrate Predictive Analytics:**
    -   Link the deep learning HCDP forecast to the DCS for automated or operator-prompted flow reduction.
    -   Assign: Process Control Engineer, IT/OT Integration Lead
3.  **Operator Training:**
    -   Train operators to recognize HCDP upward trends and act before threshold is breached.
    -   Assign: Training Coordinator
4.  **Review Control Logic:**
    -   Implement a control loop that automatically reduces flowrate in response to HCDP trend, with operator override.
    -   Assign: Process Control Engineer
5.  **Monitor and Audit:**
    -   Set up periodic audits to ensure SOPs and control logic are followed and effective.
    -   Assign: QA/QC Lead

------------------------------------------------------------------------
