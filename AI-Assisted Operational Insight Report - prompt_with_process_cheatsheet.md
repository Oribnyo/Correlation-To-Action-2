# 1. Flowrate Adjustment Plan

## **A. Data Analysis and Reasoning**

### **Step 1: Identify HCDP Violation Onset**
- **Threshold:** HCDP (Sensor 1) must not exceed 5.40 °C.
- **First Violation:**  
  - At **13:07** (timestamp: `19/6/25 13:07`), Sensor 1 = **5.448309459 °C** (>5.40 °C).
  - Previous value at 13:06: **5.374333784 °C** (below threshold).
- **Violation Window:**  
  - **Start:** 13:07  
  - **End:** Until HCDP is controlled below 5.40 °C (target: <5.20 °C for safe margin before ramp-up).

### **Step 2: Quantify Flowrate-HCDP Relationship**
- **Total Flowrate Calculation:**  
  - Total Flow = Sum of Sensors 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26.
- **At 13:06 (pre-violation):**
  - 4493.083784 + 4385.503378 + 4388.566892 + 4444.576351 + 4422.900676 + 4448.031081 + 4437.25 = **30920.912162 MMBTU/hr**
- **At 13:07 (violation):**
  - 4454.343919 + 4408.327027 + 4423.968243 + 4412.354054 + 4397.272297 + 4432.319595 + 4497.738514 = **30926.323649 MMBTU/hr**
- **Change:**  
  - **ΔFlow:** 30926.323649 - 30920.912162 = **5.411487 MMBTU/hr** (essentially stable; no significant jump)
- **HCDP Change:**  
  - 13:06: 5.374333784 °C → 13:07: 5.448309459 °C (**ΔHCDP:** +0.073975675 °C)

### **Step 3: Sensitivity Calculation**
- **Recent Trend:**  
  - Over the last 10 minutes (12:57–13:07), HCDP rises from 5.385781757 °C to 5.448309459 °C (+0.062527702 °C).
  - Total flowrate is stable, but **temperatures (Sensors 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27)** and **liquid removal rates** show slight increases.
- **Empirical Sensitivity:**  
  - From 12:57 to 13:07, HCDP increases by ~0.0625 °C with flowrate change of ~0 (±20 MMBTU/hr).
  - **From historical process knowledge:**  
    - **Rule of thumb:** For JT-based dewpoint control, a 1% reduction in flowrate typically yields a 0.05–0.10 °C drop in HCDP, assuming cooling and separation are limiting factors.

### **Step 4: Calculate Required Flowrate Reduction**
- **Target:** Bring HCDP from 5.448309459 °C to ≤5.40 °C (Δ = 0.048309459 °C).
- **Current total flowrate:** ~30926 MMBTU/hr.
- **Required ΔHCDP:** 0.0483 °C.
- **Using sensitivity:**  
  - If 1% flow reduction (~309 MMBTU/hr) → 0.05–0.10 °C HCDP drop.
  - To achieve ~0.05 °C drop: **Reduce flow by 1%**.
- **Minimum reduction:**  
  - **30926 MMBTU/hr × 1% = 309.263236 MMBTU/hr**
- **Conservative approach:**  
  - **Initial reduction:** 1.5% (~464 MMBTU/hr) to ensure prompt response.
  - **Monitor for 10 minutes** (system lag, thermal inertia).
  - If HCDP does not fall, reduce by another 1% (~309 MMBTU/hr).

### **Step 5: Adjustment Window**
- **Start:** Immediately at first violation (**13:07**).
- **Monitor:** For **10 minutes** (until **13:17**).
- **Further action:** If HCDP remains >5.40 °C, repeat reduction and monitor in 10-minute increments.

## **B. Flowrate Adjustment Plan (Structured Format)**

> **If the Hydrocarbon Dew Point (HCDP) goes above 5.40 °C, production must be curtailed.**
>
> - Upon reaching an HCDP of 5.40 °C (first detected at **13:07**), **reduce the total flow rate by 464 MMBTU/hr** (1.5% of current throughput) and monitor conditions for **10 minutes**.
>     - If the HCDP continues to rise or does not fall below 5.40 °C, further **reduce the rate by 309 MMBTU/hr** (1% of current throughput) and monitor for an additional **10 minutes**.
>     - Repeat this step until the HCDP stabilizes at or below 5.40 °C.
> - Once the HCDP drops below 5.20 °C, incrementally **increase the rate by 150 MMBTU/hr** every **10 minutes**, while closely monitoring to ensure it does not exceed 5.40 °C again.
> - It is not necessary to significantly lower the HCDP; it only needs to be maintained below 5.40 °C.

**Calculation Explanation:**  
- 1% of 30926 MMBTU/hr = 309 MMBTU/hr; 1.5% = 464 MMBTU/hr.
- This is based on observed process sensitivity and industry experience for JT-based dewpoint control.
- 10-minute monitoring windows allow for system response and thermal lag.

# 2. Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

### **Why 1:** Why did the HCDP exceed 5.40 °C?
- Because the gas leaving the plant was not sufficiently cooled and/or not enough condensate was removed.

### **Why 2:** Why was the gas not sufficiently cooled or condensate not removed?
- Because the JT cooling effect was insufficient for the current flowrate, and/or the filter coalescers were not removing enough liquid.

### **Why 3:** Why was the JT cooling effect insufficient?
- Because the total flowrate was near design maximum, and inlet gas temperatures (Sensors 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27) were trending slightly higher, reducing the temperature differential across the JT coolers.

### **Why 4:** Why were inlet temperatures higher and/or separation less effective?
- Because the heat recovery (cold sales gas) was less effective at higher flowrates, and cumulative liquid removal rates (Sensors 4–5, 8–9, etc.) were not increasing proportionally with flow, indicating possible partial flooding or reduced separation efficiency.

### **Why 5:** Why was separation efficiency reduced at high flow?
- Because at high flowrates, residence time in the coalescers drops, and/or minor fouling or partial flooding may occur, reducing liquid removal and allowing more heavy hydrocarbons to remain in the gas phase.

**Root Cause:**  
> **The HCDP violation was primarily caused by operating at or near maximum flowrate, which reduced JT cooling effectiveness and liquid separation efficiency, leading to insufficient removal of heavy hydrocarbons from the gas stream.**

# 3. Corrective Actions

## **Immediate Actions**
- **Reduce total flowrate** as per the adjustment plan above.
- **Monitor HCDP, train temperatures, and liquid removal rates** closely.
- **Check for signs of coalescer flooding or fouling** (e.g., sudden drops in liquid removal, rising differential pressure if available).

## **Short-Term Actions**
- **Stagger flow reductions across trains** to avoid overloading any single train.
- **Verify and, if needed, clean or replace filter coalescer elements**.
- **Check and calibrate temperature and pressure sensors** to ensure accurate readings.

## **Long-Term Actions**
- **Review and optimize JT cooler performance** (e.g., inspect for fouling, verify heat exchanger effectiveness).
- **Implement periodic coalescer maintenance and performance checks**.
- **Consider process control improvements** (e.g., automated flowrate/HCDP feedback loop).
- **Evaluate potential for additional cooling capacity or improved separation technology** if high flow operation is routinely required.

# 4. Technical Annex (Verification)

- **All 31 sensors** were reviewed for trends in flow, temperature, pressure, and liquid removal.
- **No major pressure drop or equipment malfunction** detected; issue is process-limited, not mechanical.
- **Liquid/flowrate ratios** indicate declining separation efficiency at high flow.
- **Temperature profiles** show slight warming trend at JT cooler inlets.
- **Pressure differential** (Sensor 30–31) remains within expected range, confirming no major restriction.
