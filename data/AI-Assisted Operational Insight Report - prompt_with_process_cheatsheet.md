Certainly. Here is a comprehensive, senior-level process engineering analysis and action plan based on your data and requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Flowrate Adjustment Plan

## **A. Data Review and Violation Detection**

-   **HCDP Violation:**
    -   **Threshold:** 5.40 °C (Sensor 1)
    -   **First Exceedance:**
        -   **Timestamp:** `19/6/25 13:07`
        -   **Sensor 1 Value:** 5.448309 °C
-   **Preceding Trend:**
    -   HCDP (Sensor 1) rises steadily from \~5.0 °C at 12:00 to 5.448 °C at 13:07.
    -   Total flowrate (sum of Sensors 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26) is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations.
    -   Gas temperatures (Sensors 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27) are increasing.
    -   Liquid removal rates (Sensors 4–5, 8–9, etc.) are not increasing proportionally to flow or temperature.
    -   Pressure differential (Sensor 30 - Sensor 31) is stable, but entrance pressure is slightly decreasing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **B. Flowrate–HCDP Correlation Analysis**

### **Step 1: Calculate Total Flowrate at Violation**

At `13:07`: - Sensor 2: 4454.344 - Sensor 6: 4408.327 - Sensor 10: 4423.968 - Sensor 14: 4412.354 - Sensor 18: 4397.272 - Sensor 22: 4432.320 - Sensor 26: 4497.739

**Total Flowrate:**\
= 4454.344 + 4408.327 + 4423.968 + 4412.354 + 4397.272 + 4432.320 + 4497.739\
= **30926.324 MMBTU/hr**

### **Step 2: Estimate HCDP Sensitivity to Flowrate**

-   **Observation:**
    -   From 12:00 (HCDP ≈ 5.03 °C, Flow ≈ 30900 MMBTU/hr) to 13:07 (HCDP ≈ 5.45 °C, Flow ≈ 30926 MMBTU/hr), HCDP increases by ≈0.42 °C with negligible flowrate change.
    -   However, temperature in each train rises by \~0.7 °C, and liquid removal does not increase, indicating cooling/separation is limiting.
-   **Empirical Sensitivity:**
    -   From 12:00 to 13:07, HCDP increases ≈0.42 °C.
    -   Flowrate is nearly constant, so HCDP is more sensitive to temperature and separation efficiency than to flowrate alone.
    -   However, reducing flowrate will reduce heat load and allow better cooling/separation.
-   **Historical Data:**
    -   At 11:14 (HCDP = 4.84 °C, Flow = 4390+4411+4448+4468+4452+4426+4410 = 30905 MMBTU/hr)
    -   At 12:00 (HCDP = 5.03 °C, Flow = 4458+4460+4437+4473+4413+4449+4404 = 30994 MMBTU/hr)
    -   **ΔFlow ≈ 89 MMBTU/hr, ΔHCDP ≈ 0.19 °C**\
        → **Sensitivity ≈ 0.0021 °C per MMBTU/hr**

### **Step 3: Calculate Required Flow Reduction**

-   **Target:** Bring HCDP from 5.45 °C to ≤5.40 °C (Δ = 0.05 °C)
-   **Required Flow Reduction:**
    -   ΔFlow = ΔHCDP / Sensitivity = 0.05 °C / 0.0021 °C per MMBTU/hr ≈ **24 MMBTU/hr**
-   **However:**
    -   This is a theoretical minimum. In practice, due to process lag and nonlinearity, a **conservative reduction of 100–150 MMBTU/hr** is recommended for prompt effect and to account for system inertia.

### **Step 4: Define Reduction Window**

-   **Start:** Immediately upon HCDP reaching 5.40 °C (`13:07`)
-   **Monitor:** For at least 15 minutes (system lag, heat exchange, and separation response)
-   **If HCDP does not drop:** Further reduce by another 100 MMBTU/hr and monitor for another 15 minutes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Flowrate Adjustment Plan (Final Format)**

> **If the Hydrocarbon Dew Point (HCDP) goes above 5.40 °C, production must be curtailed.**
>
> -   Upon reaching an HCDP of 5.40 °C (at `19/6/25 13:07`), reduce the total flow rate by **150 MMBTU/hr** (from 30926 to 30776 MMBTU/hr) and monitor conditions for **15 minutes**.
>     -   If the HCDP continues to rise or does not fall below 5.40 °C, further reduce the rate by **another 100 MMBTU/hr** and monitor for an additional **15 minutes**.
>     -   Repeat this step until the HCDP stabilizes at or below 5.40 °C.
> -   Once the HCDP drops below 5.20 °C, incrementally increase the rate by **50 MMBTU/hr** every **15 minutes**, while closely monitoring to ensure it does not exceed 5.40 °C again.
> -   It is not necessary to significantly lower the HCDP; it only needs to be maintained below 5.40 °C.

**Reasoning:**\
- The calculated minimum reduction is \~24 MMBTU/hr, but a 150 MMBTU/hr reduction is recommended for operational effectiveness and to account for process lag and nonlinearity. - The window is set to 15 minutes per step to allow for system stabilization and measurement lag.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

### **1st Why:**

**Why did the HCDP exceed 5.40 °C?**\
Because the gas leaving the plant was not sufficiently cooled and/or not enough condensate was removed, resulting in higher residual heavy hydrocarbons in the sales gas.

### **2nd Why:**

**Why was the gas not sufficiently cooled or liquids not adequately removed?**\
Because the JT cooling effect was insufficient to condense out enough heavy hydrocarbons, and/or the filter coalescers were not removing all condensed liquids.

### **3rd Why:**

**Why was the JT cooling effect insufficient?**\
Because the inlet gas temperature to the JT valve was rising (all train temperatures increased by \~1.5 °C over the period), and the heat exchange with cold sales gas was less effective, possibly due to high flow rates and/or fouling.

### **4th Why:**

**Why did the inlet gas temperature rise and heat exchange become less effective?**\
Because the total flowrate was maintained near maximum, increasing the heat load on the JT coolers, and there may be fouling or underperformance in the heat exchangers or insufficient cold gas return.

### **5th Why:**

**Why was the flowrate kept high and/or heat exchanger performance degraded?**\
Because production targets were prioritized, and there may be a lack of proactive maintenance or monitoring of heat exchanger performance and liquid removal efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Root Cause:**\
**Sustained high flowrates near design maximum, combined with rising inlet gas temperatures and possible heat exchanger fouling, led to insufficient JT cooling and liquid removal, causing the HCDP to exceed specification.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. Corrective Actions

## **Immediate Actions**

-   **Reduce total flowrate by 150 MMBTU/hr immediately upon HCDP violation.**
-   **Monitor HCDP, train temperatures, and liquid removal rates every minute.**
-   **Check for abnormal temperature rises or pressure drops across JT coolers and filter coalescers.**
-   **If possible, rebalance flow among trains to optimize cooling and separation (e.g., reduce flow in trains with higher outlet temperatures).**

## **Short-Term Actions**

-   **Inspect and clean JT coolers and heat exchangers for fouling.**
-   **Check filter coalescer performance and replace elements if differential pressure is high or liquid removal is subpar.**
-   **Review and calibrate temperature and pressure sensors for accuracy.**

## **Long-Term Actions**

-   **Implement predictive maintenance for JT coolers and filter coalescers.**
-   **Install or enhance real-time monitoring and alarms for temperature rise, liquid removal rates, and HCDP approach to threshold.**
-   **Review operating procedures to ensure flowrate is proactively adjusted based on temperature and HCDP trends, not just after violations.**
-   **Consider process optimization studies to improve heat integration and separation efficiency, possibly including upgrades to heat exchangers or coalescers.**
